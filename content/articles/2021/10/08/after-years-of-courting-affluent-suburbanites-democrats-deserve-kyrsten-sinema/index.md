As you've probably observed if you've been paying any attention to the ongoing negotiations over infrastructure spending, Democratic lawmakers and voters are growing increasingly frustrated with Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema. She is one of two Senators currently preventing the passage of a $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill which would finance long overdue additions to the social safety net, including universal pre-K and expansion of Medicare.

Whereas her partner in crime, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, has at least gone through the motions of [making a counter-offer](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/574715-manchin-says-his-spending-limit-is-15-trillion), Sinema has been defiantly silent throughout the process, dodging the media and her own constituents, and instead [meeting behind closed doors with her corporate donors](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/10/sinema-leaves-dc-for-high-end-corporate-fundraiser-as-she-blocks-biden-spending-bill/).

Her silent obstructionism has many Democrats upset that she is inflicting further damage upon an already embattled Biden White House by denying the administration a sorely needed legislative win. Progressives always knew Sinema would be a problem, even if many did support her challenge to Republican incumbent Martha McSally in 2018, but even her fellow "moderates" seem to be catching on to the fact that she's an enemy of progress.

And while moderate liberals' increasingly open disdain for Sinema is a positive development overall, these same Democrats ought to remember that their party, since the 2016 election, has tailored its messaging and policy positions specifically to court affluent white suburban voters - the very people who elect Senators like Kyrsten Sinema. 

Progressives were told in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns that Bernie Sanders, while exciting to the young, progressive base of the party, couldn't win a general election because his ideas were too "radical" to be embraced by this emerging cohort of upper-middle class suburban voters - or, [as Rahm Emanuel branded them, "Biden Republicans."](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/this-will-be-the-year-of-the-biden-republican-rahm-emanuel-says.html)

And so, in both primary contests, the party brass put its thumb on the scale against Sanders' candidacy, in favor of centrists who they felt would deliver them this new coalition of well-to-do suburban centrists who were liberal on social issues, but economically more conservative. These kinds of voters were [critical to putting Sinema over the top in her 2018 Senate bid](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/10/29/arizona-senate-race-why-martha-mcsally-kyrsten-sinema-targeting-suburban-women/1745779002/), as well as to the Democrats' overall success in those midterms. They've been been explicitly catering to them ever since.

It therefore stands to reason that the party would eventually face the very crisis in which it now finds itself. Sinema is a newly elected moderate sent to Washington by fiscally conservative independents, and she's acting accordingly. Democrats can be upset about this all they'd like, but they have only themselves to blame for their current predicament. Because Sinema, an eccentric bisexual who votes against minimum wage increases and the strengthening of social programs, represents the exact kind of voter Democrats welcomed into their party with open arms these past three election cycles (2020, 2018, and 2016).

And so, the current stalemate within the party between progressives and centrists makes perfect sense. The very premise of the Democratic Party - a party "for the little guy," funded by wealthy donors and corporate interests - is a laughable self-contradiction. Should anyone be surprised that it's having trouble unifying behind even the most modest of public investments like hearing aids for senior citizens?

Comedian and [political commentator Graham Elwood](https://www.google.com/search?q=graham+elwood&oq=graham+elwood&aqs=chrome..69i57j46i512j69i59j0i512l3j69i61l2.3665j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) aptly describes the Democratic Party as "Goldman Sachs with a rainbow flag." Tell me that isn't spot on, and tell me it doesn't describe Kyrsten Sinema to a tee. If you can't (and you can't), then it should come as no surprise that the party of corporate wokeness and virtue signaling neoliberalism is eating itself alive in a doomed effort to negotiate its way out of its own inherent and inescapable paradox.

The Democratic Party had a chance, in 2016, to become the kind of party that would have no problem passing legislation like the Build Back Better Act. Party leadership vehemently opposed such a shift, and a majority of Democratic voters followed their lead. This embarrassing public implosion in which the party ["for the people"](https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/floor-speech-on-the-for-the-people-act) can't even unify behind measures as basic as adding dental coverage to Medicare, is just punishment for their disgraceful behavior these past five years.

Unfortunately, we're all collateral damage.
