These days Joe Biden is a tragic figure and also a symbolic one. As he dodders and mumbles his way through the rare press conference and occasional speech, it's hard not to feel like we're into the final scenes of King Lear, with the monarch's mind crumbling under the weight of too many cruel realities arriving at a time in life when he is least able to manage them. Watching him try - and fail repeatedly - to master situations from Covid to Afghanistan to a dysfunctional Congress, gives one the uncomfortable feeling, no matter your politics, of catching a glimpse at our own national reflection. 

If Trump represented America's wounded Id having a tantrum, Biden is its increasingly out of touch Ego, seeing a man of 35 in the mirror, even as everyone around him prepares to fight over the estate he's going to be leaving behind very shortly.

As in any great tragedy, the seeds of Biden's destruction were sown in the very moment of his triumph. Having resoundingly lost the first three primary states, he was rescued only by divine intervention, or the Democratic Party equivalent: an intercession by his old boss, Barack. But there are consequences for foisting a candidate on the public that no one particularly likes, trusts, or believes in. In [exit polls](https://morningconsult.com/exit-polling-live-updates/), 44% of Biden supporters saw their vote as a rejection of Trump. Only 54% saw it as a vote for Biden. For Trump, those numbers were 22% and 75% respectively. 

It could be a case of Yeats' lines regarding the lack of conviction among the best while the worst are full of "passionate intensity," playing out in real time, but it probably has more to do with the fact that Trump's voters actively chose Trump. 

Biden, on the other hand, was never anything more than a hastily constructed bulwark against the party's rising progressive wing. That's a flimsy premise for a presidency and was never going to hold up for very long to the scrutiny that comes with the job. It's also a weak hand to play in negotiations with both official Republicans and the unofficial ones within his own party. 

Manchin has so little care about incurring the historically unpopular Biden's wrath (only Trump was more disliked at this point in presidency) that he literally [talked down to his own voters from the stern of his yacht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vg1cjXM6x8) this week as they demanded he support $3.5T in infrastructure spending. And Sinema seems to take a special delight in defying him, as if she's fantasizing about all the lucrative board memberships she's going to accumulate when her public service is done and [she's able to cash in her chits](https://www.salon.com/2021/09/23/big-pharma-firms-donated-750k-to-kyrsten-sinema--then-she-opposed-bill/).  

If we get an infrastructure bill at all, it's going to be even more woefully inadequate to meeting the needs of the moment than the one currently under consideration. 

It's often been observed by his opponents on the left that Biden turned out to be better than anyone expected, but that's only because the bar for his presidency had been set at a subterranean level. This is the man who gleefully incarcerated a generation of black men, while [bragging that his crime bill would "do everything but hang people for jay walking."](https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-touted-crime-bill-1992-death-penalty-jaywalking-senate-2019-6) Anything short of riding up to the White House on a horse in full Grand Wizard regalia to take the oath of office was going to look like a miracle of late-in-life progressive conversion.

Yes, Biden is better than anyone expected him to be. But he isn't nearly as good as we needed him to be. We needed the FDR, or failing that, at least the [LBJ that Biden reportedly sees himself as](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/is-biden-really-the-second-coming-of-fdr-and-lbj). What we got is a walking, talking, daily reminder of just how far we've fallen as a country. His befuddlement, frustration and ineffectiveness are our own, as is his nostalgia for a time when we had more turns left in the game, and our possible moves seemed infinite. 

A serious nation that is qualified to lead the world, even in a lets-start-pointless-wars-in-order-to-enrich-our-corporations kind of a way, would never have elected Biden or his predecessor. Our allies and enemies alike have noticed and their way of dealing with the United States is now along the lines of the way one deals with a crazy, rich uncle. *Think about the inheritance. Smile and nod. Remind yourself that he won't be around for much longer.*
