On Tuesday, [*The New York Times* reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/business/biden-agenda-congress-democrats.html) that President Biden, in meetings with House Democrats, has significantly lowered his goals on additional infrastructure spending. Until now, he has thrown in with progressives who insisted on passing a $3.5 trillion package in addition to the $1 trillion bipartisan bill.

Biden's new ceiling is apparently $2.3 trillion, a drastic reduction from an already compromised number (as [Bernie Sanders has repeatedly stated](https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-says-35-trillion-is-price-tag-manchin-sinema-pushback-2021-9), progressives initially wanted a $6 trillion deal).

Up to this point, House progressives have wisely touted their support from the president, and attached themselves to Biden's "Build Back Better" agenda. Perhaps it was their legitimate claim to Biden's allyship that emboldened them to hold firm at their $3.5 trillion price tag, as they have maintained their position over the past several weeks despite pressure from moderates in the party and their corporate backers.

Now that Biden has essentially caved (editor's note: surprise, surprise), progressives' true test has arrived. They now must have the courage to remain steadfast in their demands *without* the cover that comes with attaching themselves to the leader of their party, the President of the United States.

Now that Biden has signaled that the high end of the settlement will be more like $2.3 trillion, the same progressives who banded together to [block the $1 trillion package last week](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-09-30/house-infrastructure-vote) will have to publicly defy party leadership - including the president - if they want to drive that amount higher.

Whether they have it in them to do that remains to be seen. In the American Rescue Plan negotiations, House progressives didn't put up a fight to keep Bernie Sanders' minimum wage provision in the bill after [eight Senate Democrats teamed up with Republicans to defeat it](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/05/democrats-15-minimum-wage-hike-473875). So if past is prologue, there's little reason for optimism. 

If there is cause for hope, it's that they have publicly dug in already on this infrastructure fight, and that caving now would be seen as yet another humiliating defeat for the Left. Pramila Jayapal instantly rejected at Joe Manchin's ludicrous $1.5 trillion offer, saying plainly, ["That's not going to happen."](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/03/jayapal-rejects-manchin-biden-spending-plan-514973) Whether she and her caucus can maintain that same level of confidence without clear support from party leadership is now the big question regarding the fate of the infrastructure bill.
