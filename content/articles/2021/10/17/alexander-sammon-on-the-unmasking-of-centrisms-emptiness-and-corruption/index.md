Alexander Sammon, staff writer at *The American Prospect,* wrote a recent article entitled ["The Undignified Demise of Centrism."](https://prospect.org/infrastructure/building-back-america/undignified-demise-of-centrism/) In it, he concludes:

*"Centrism, now, is imperiled as a political orientation not for its competitive viability, but for the emptiness and corruption that has been exposed at its heart. Not a single young voter, or someone politically up for grabs, can look to the leadership of Kyrsten Sinema or Scott Peters and see a politician with a positive vision for governance and society, one they could believe in, knock on doors for, or turn out to vote for."*

As negotiations continue over the Biden administration's infrastructure plan, so-called "centrist" Democrats in both the House and Senate have raised objections to the $3.5 trillion reconciliation package championed by both progressives and the White House.

Moderates holding up the legislative process by insisting that plans be watered down is nothing new. But Sammon argues in his piece that what is unique to this particular fight is that this time, centrists aren't even bothering to disguise their obstructionism as anything but what it is: hollow and nihilistic corruption.

Kyrsten Sinema is [teaching a college course on fundraising](https://theintercept.com/2021/10/08/kyrsten-sinema-fundraising-course-asu/) (yes, that's right) while refusing to offer any rationale for her objection to the Build Back Better Act. 

[Joe Manchin is steadfastly (and successfully) chipping away at Biden's climate proposals](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/climate/biden-clean-energy-manchin.html) while [raking in huge amounts of money from the fossil fuel industry](https://news.yahoo.com/manchin-accepted-over-400-000-211905637.html), and having [gotten rich off his own coal company which he founded in 1988.](https://www.salon.com/2021/10/02/joe-manchin-has-made-52m-from-his-coal-company--and-gets-big-donations-from-fossil-fuel-industry_partner/)

Congressman Scott Peters, as Sammon cites in his article, [all but openly admitted the corrupting influence of pharmaceutical donations on his decision making process](https://www.dailyposter.com/dems-spin-control-over-pharma-cash-and-drug-pricing-vote/), insisting that refusing their donations would be tantamount to "defunding" his campaign and "let[ting] Republicans win."

Unlike most intra-party fights where centrists play an active role in negotiations and submit their own counteroffers to more progressive proposals, this time they're making no such effort. They're simply saying no for the sake of it, offering the American people no explanation other than the one many are arriving at themselves, which is that centrism as a governing philosophy is both morally and intellectually bankrupt, and bolstered by nothing more than the undue influence of corporate money in politics.
