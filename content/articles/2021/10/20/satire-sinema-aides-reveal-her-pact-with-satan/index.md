##### *"She literally has the devil on speed dial," says terrified intern*

**A special Halloween-time investigation**

Senator Krysten Sinema this week denied claims that she sold her soul to the devil in exchange for earthly power and riches after several former and current aides came forward to make the accusation. 

"Can't anyone just be bought off anymore?" Sinema replied to one reporter inquiring about her alleged connections to Lucifer, adding, "I also don't appreciate the sexist â€˜in thrall to the Devil' trope. When it's a man, he's simply corrupt. When it's a woman who's violated every principle she ever claimed to hold, all of a sudden everyone thinks she's gone to a crossroads in the middle of Tempe, stripped naked under a full moon, sacrificed an animal of some sort in the delicious night air, possibly an armadillo, and given herself completely to the Dark Lord, body and soul. It's just wrong and I won't stand for it."

Still, rumors persist that through her voting record, Sinema is preparing the way for the antichrist foretold in the Book of Revelations, under the direction of one or several demonic entities. 

According to Arizona State University lecturer and demonology expert, Dr. William Hellstrom, Sinema's journey from Green Party candidate and immigrants' rights activist to human pharma cash vacuum attachment is typical of those who sell their souls to the Devil. 

"We see this again and again throughout history," he said from inside a protective circle made up of hastily scrawled ancient runes, "Caligula, Napoleon, even Atilla the Hun; they all started out with noble intentions, but in the end they weren't able to resist the Prince of Lies. How do you think Nancy Pelosi made $150 million dollars as a sitting member of Congress anyway? Sinema has already racked up her first million and believe me, she's just getting started."

Perhaps most disturbing is the series of disappearances connected to Sinema's office. Since she was first elected to the Arizona State House in 2011, no less than 12 of the Senator's interns and staff members have gone missing under mysterious circumstances. 

The pattern has not gone unnoticed by some of the parents and partners of the missing, who have created the non-profit Loved Ones of Missing Krysten Sinema Aides and Interns (LOMKSAI), with the aim of pressuring law enforcement to investigate. 

Mary Cafferty, spokeswoman for the group and mother of one of Sinema's alleged victims said, "It's very clear that something evil is going on in that office. Who holds up a vote on lowering prescription drug prices, then just runs off to the gym like nothing happened? Her familiars in the police department need to stop conspiring with the Beast and do their jobs."

One wan and clearly terrified intern who spoke only on condition of anonymity painted a chilling picture of life inside Sinema's office, "Everyone has to wear a sweater because it's always freezing, even in the middle of summer and that's without air conditioning. It can be 90 degrees out and you can still see your breath. Of the staff that was here when I started, I'm the only one left. And also, I've been having these crazy dreams of her scratching at my window, asking to be invited in. And after every disappearance, she seems, like, I don't know... younger." 

Here she paused, her eyes darting nervously as if afraid someone might be listening, before whispering, "I'm afraid I'm going to be next."
