**An interview with Brett Story by Keaton Weiss and Richie Rosencrans**

Brett Story is a Candian author, filmmaker, and prison abolitionist. In 2016, she released her documentary film *[The Prison in Twelve Landscapes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5546192/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)*, and three years later, published a book called *[Prison Land: Mapping Carceral Power Across Neoliberal America](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42099815-prison-land)*.

Last August, she hosted a reading and discussion of her book at a small bookstore near our hometown. We reached out to her to request a short interview at the bookstore before her event, and she was kind enough to make some time for us. We published this interview on our podcast shortly after recording it, but given our current moment, we thought it prudent to republish this conversation.

Brett became involved in criminal justice efforts through her work as a housing and anti-gentrification activist in Montreal. Through this work, she witnessed firsthand the relationship between neoliberal austerity policy and the carceral state, which is the topic of this brief but thorough discussion that we hope you find informative and enlightening.
