*White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism* is a book by Robin DiAngelo about her experiences as a for-hire diversity trainer for corporate America. The book was first published in 2018, but has recently soared atop the *New York Times* bestseller list as race relations are back in the forefront of our collective consciousness.

At first glance, this appears to be a positive development. The murder of George Floyd and the protest movement that has arisen in its wake have created a cultural moment in which Americans of all backgrounds seem more committed than usual to creating a less racist society. But is *White Fragility* really the book we should be looking to to help realize this goal? Cedrick-Michael Simmons, writer and instructor at Ithaca College, argues against this proposition in his thorough and incisive article entitled ["I'm Black and Afraid of White Fragility."](https://www.thebellows.org/im-black-and-afraid-of-white-fragility/)  
 
Simmons debunks the very premise that racism can be effectively combated with diversity training. He also offers a more systemic critique that such training programs shift all civic responsibility from employers and corporations to individual workers. And finally, he makes a more essential argument that DiAngelo fundamentally rejects the idea that there is such a thing as a universal human experience, and instead promotes racial essentialism.
