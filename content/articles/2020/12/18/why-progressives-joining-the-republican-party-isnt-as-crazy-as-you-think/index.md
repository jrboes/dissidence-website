*Publisher's Note: This article was first published in December of 2020. Given recent developments in which many Republican candidates and politicians are running on policies like a [public healthcare option](https://www.mccarthyforcongressny.com/issues), [marijuana decriminalization](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/south-carolina-republican-introduces-bill-decriminalize-marijuana-federal-level-n1283913), and [Universal Basic Income](https://pix11.com/news/politics/new-york-elections/republican-mayoral-candidate-sliwa-pitches-ubi-program/), we've decided to recirculate it for your reading pleasure.*

I know what you're thinking: whaaaaaaaaaat!? But hear me out. The progressive case for voting Biden was [best articulated by Noam Chomsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnZUHQHGTYM&feature=emb_logo), and boiled down to this: as an activist, whether you like or don't like a candidate or party doesn't really enter into it. Your personal feelings must always be subordinated to your larger goals, and you should always vote based on which candidate is going to be the best vehicle for achieving your policy objectives. By that standard, I think there's a good case to be made for progressives aligning themselves with the emerging economic populist wing of the GOP, and fighting its evangelical wing on cultural issues, rather than remaining within the Democratic Party and fighting its establishment on literally everything. Here's why:

### The Democratic Brand Is Toxic

Between its cultural signaling and its constant failure to delver for its constituents, the party has lost the good will of essentially everyone who doesn't live on the coasts, and even on the coasts, is only really popular in urban areas. In my home state of New York, electoral maps show a bubble of New York City blue floating in an ocean of red, and the same goes for the entire Northeast, from Boston to Providence to Hartford. Slapping the D on your campaign materials isn't an asset in most places, it's a liability.

### Republicans Win and It's Only Going To Get Worse

Even in the face of a President who mostly seemed like he had just stepped out of a savage political farce about American politics that might have been written in the years before it actually happened, Joe Biden barely squeaked by. It took a once in a century pandemic and an unfathomably incompetent response from the administration to secure the Presidency for Democrats. 

But you can't always count on an apocalypse. Even with an ongoing sci-fi dystopia scenario playing out in real time, and even with record turn-out, which is theoretically supposed to favor Democrats, the party managed to lose Governorships, state legislatures, house seats, and some very winnable Senate races. 

Because of those losses, next year's post-census redistricting will be done primarily by Republicans. By the time they've gotten through gerrymandering the country, there are going to be about 6 Democrats left in the House. The next shot at Congress will come in 2032, after the next census. That sound like a star you want to hitch your wagon to? Is that a party that's going to serve as the best vehicle for pushing your agenda?

### The GOP Lets Its Voters Decide: A Tale of Two Insurgents

This is a subtle point, but a very important one, because it has an enormous impact on candidate selection and the degree to which GOP voters are able to influence the party's legislative agenda. 

In 2016, both parties were rocked by the unexpected rise of unlikely outsider candidates running on an economic populist agenda that was completely at odds with the ideology of their leadership. In both cases, the media complexes that support those parties respectively tried to delegitimize the insurgents, and the parties ' leading figures did everything they could to instruct their voters not to support them. But in only one case did the party work behind the scenes to rig the primary process against one candidate. And it wasn't the GOP. 

We know from [Wikileaks](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/damaging-emails-dnc-wikileaks-dump/story?id=40852448) and [Donna Brazile](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774), that the DNC conspired with the Clinton campaign to sink Bernie Sanders' candidacy. This was in spite of the fact that there was no reason to believe that he would lose in a general election, based on the polling. In fact, he generally [outperformed Clinton in a theoretical match-up with Trump](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/mar/08/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-he-consistently-beats-donald-t/). 

The GOP, on the other hand, had every reason to believe that Trump would be defeated in a landslide, no matter who emerged the victor on the Democratic side. And yet, even in the face of not only a hostile takeover of their party, but in the face of an almost certain humiliating defeat, the GOP didn't conspire against its own voters to secure a desired outcome. Which means that if you're supporting a candidate in a GOP primary who has the most volunteers and grass roots donations in history, and that candidate goes on to win the first 3 primary states, chances are they're going to be the nominee. 

On the other hand, as we saw again in 2020 with the [Obama-orchestrated Monday night massacre](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/politics/obama-biden-democratic-primary.html), the Democratic Party will stop at nothing to prevent anyone who threatens to derail the revolving door gravy train from gaining any real power within their party.    

### Our Working Class Base Is In the GOP

It's hard to run on economic populism inside a party dominated by upscale suburban liberals. Sure, they'll vaguely nod their heads and agree in the abstract on principles like M4A, and labor rights, but it isn't something they really give two shits about. And let's face it: the idea of working-class solidarity scares them. 

Just like in some way the continued paranoia about Russia is based in ancient fears of the Mongol hordes swooping in from the steppe, the petit-bourgeois contempt for economic populism is based in their ancient class fear of being dragged from their homes by the impoverished masses and sent off to a political re-education camp. 

That's a big part of why they've embraced the new religion of "critical race theory." People who are busy hating each other because of their skin color, can't unite. It also helps to deflect from their class privilege when they spend all their political energy superficially denouncing their own race privilege. 

Now, you might be saying that even if the working class is in the GOP, those voters represent a subset of the working class that's hostile to social welfare programs. But if you've ever watched [Bernie Sanders' Fox News town hall,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-v4smNupNs) in which the audience applauds repeatedly for his entire agenda even with the hosts attempting to re-direct them back to the "socialist" boogeyman, you know that's bs. 

It wouldn't take much to win these people over. In fact, Trump already proved that by running to Clinton's left on health care, trade, and war. He didn't mean any of it, but that doesn't really matter in terms of evaluating the potency of an economic populist message among rank-and-file Republicans. Now imagine what someone who walked the walk instead of just talking the talk could do.

### GOP Voters Don't Take Marching Orders

If they did, Jeb Bush would have been the 2016 nominee. They didn't really give a fuck what Mitt Romney, or Rush Limbaugh, or anyone over at Fox had to say about it. They wanted Trump and they picked him, party establishment be damned.

On the contrary, in 2020, Democratic voters rejected the candidate that polling showed they [most trusted on every issue of importance to them](https://www.newsweek.com/2020-democratic-primary-bernie-sanders-polls-policies-democratic-socialism-1469949), in favor of someone who started his campaign waxing rhapsodic over his [past collaborations with avowed segregationists](https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-biden-segregationist-senator-never-called-me-boy). And they did this, even as the country was exploding in the worst series of race riots since the 60's. Why? Because their leaders and their media told them to. There was literally no other reason to support a man that got crushed in the first 3 states, and who [polling showed they didn't even particularly like](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-consolidates-support-trails-badly-enthusiasm-poll/story?id=69812092). 

Even setting aside every other point in this article, this one is impossible to get around. You can never reform a party whose own voters are so spineless that all it takes is a thumbs down from Barrack Obama to persuade them to vote against the candidate they trust, in favor of one that they've been told can win. [They were told that in 2016 too](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/thomas-jefferson-street/articles/2016-10-28/7-reasons-why-hillary-clintons-win-over-donald-trump-is-a-done-deal), mostly by the same people, but that doesn't seem to have made an impression.

Given the tightness of the margins, we can safely say that without corona, Biden would have been destroyed in 2020, and we had no idea how bad corona was going to be on Super Tuesday. With the GOP base, you have a chance to make your case, and if you make it successfully, you can actually win. With the Democrats, you'll never win. Because even setting the leadership aside, their base is trash.

### People of Color are Jumping Ship

Donald Trump [performed better with non-white voters than any Republican candidate since 1960](https://www.aol.com/news/trump-won-highest-share-non-164843048.html). Donald. Frikkin'. Trump. Why would that be, after years of media coverage that essentially wrote off his entire base as unreconstructed racists, in spite of the millions of [two-time Obama voters who voted Trump](https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/442753-clinton-suffered-most-from-obama-voters-voting-for-trump-in) in 2016? Well, a few reasons probably.

For one, [black voters](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/11/01/donald-trump-african-american-black-economic-progress-vote-column/6081310002/) saw historically low unemployment and poverty rates under Trump. Trump was also the first president to create [permanent funding for HBCU's](https://apnews.com/article/c4834e48841d97c5a93312b1bf75302a) and the [first to sign legislation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-celebrates-criminal-justice-reform-bill-at-white-house/) aimed at undoing some of the insane sentencing guidelines of the current President-Elect's infamous 1994 crime bill. And in a major rebuke of woke assumptions, black voters as a group are the most hostile to *legal* immigration, with [85% in favor of reducing it](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54972389). 

On top of that, [younger black voters are turning on the Democratic Party in droves](https://theconversation.com/young-black-americans-not-sold-on-biden-the-democrats-or-voting-143884), with only 47% between the ages of 18-29 saying that they see the party as welcoming to black Americans, and remarkably, only 51% seeing it as more welcoming than the GOP. 

The story is much the same with Latinos, who it turns out not only aren't all that into white liberals [telling them what to call themselves](https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2020/08/11/about-one-in-four-u-s-hispanics-have-heard-of-latinx-but-just-3-use-it/) under the assumption that their own language is inherently sexist (if you can find a better example of the "white savior" mentality in modern times, please let me know what it is), but tend to be [to the right of white Democrats on immigration](https://forward.com/opinion/457887/the-real-lesson-of-the-election-people-of-color-are-not-a-monolith-and/). 

It's almost like people are multi-faceted and not simply defined by their race. Who knew? Definitely not the Democrats, apparently. If these trends continue (and there's no reason to believe they won't after listening to [Biden's recent Trumpesque exchange with black civil rights leaders](https://theintercept.com/2020/12/10/biden-audio-meeting-civil-rights-leaders/)), we're looking at a looming GOP majority as far as the eye can see.

### When the Democrats Are In Power, They Do As Much If Not More Damage To Their Base Than the GOP

Why is it that the party that supposedly cares the most about POC and the working class often does the most real structural, legislative damage to those communities while in office? Partly it's because they believe those voters have nowhere else to go, and as a result those aren't the voters they care about. 

The GOP, on the other hand, knows that because of their built-in advantage with whites, all they have to do is make a few percentage points gain with POC to beat the Democrats across the map. As a result, Democrats are the ones most likely to gut welfare and pass unpopular trade deals like NAFTA, while the GOP are more likely to do sentencing reform. It's about politics, not ethics, but the end result is the same. 

Also, when the GOP wants to pass legislation that's obviously hostile to workers and/or POC, the Dems will fight it for political reasons and the media will cover the subject more critically. 

Add to that the stigma the GOP carries as the party of white people, and it's hard for them to pass overtly racist legislation without scrutiny. If you want to make it legal to put shock collars on workers, or carcinogens in black neighborhoods, you need to call it the Worker Safety and Water Enhancement Act, and get a Democratic President to slow jam it on Jimmy Fallon, [a la Obama and the TPP](https://www.vox.com/2016/6/10/11901944/obama-jimmy-fallon-slow-jam-tpp). 
ng class figured this out a long time ago, and that's a big part of why they migrated to the GOP. With minority communities now following suit, who's going to be left to vote for Democrats?

### Freedom of Speech

As an artist and a politics blogger, this is a big one for me. We've seen the Democrats take on a lot of characteristics and opinions that have been historically associated with the right-wing over the last four years: Cold-war style Russophobia with all the attendant McCarthyite red-baiting of political opponents, even (perhaps especially) those on the left; unquestioning lionization of the intelligence services, accompanied by a blind acceptance of any and all claims they might make; a censorious holier-than-thou moral hysteria worthy of the Victorian era. 

It's unsurprising then that people who have begun to think in a way that we usually associate with 1950's wing-nuts, have come up with similar solutions to the perceived problem of Russian influence and moral turpitude among the citizenry: [book banning](https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5bv3x/penguin-random-house-staff-confront-publisher-about-new-jordan-peterson-book), [de-platforming](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bjbp9d/do-social-media-bans-work), and [blacklists](https://nypost.com/2020/11/10/trump-administration-blacklist-pushed-by-ex-obama-spokesman/). The bedrock American principle that tolerating speech isn't the same thing as supporting it, has been abandoned by a modern left which seems to think that leaving it to tech oligarchs to decide which speech is and isn't fit for mass consumption is a grand idea that will never come back to bite them in the ass. 

These are the same people who never anticipated that Democratic support for the Patriot Act would cause any particular problems, right up until the federal forces created under its provisions went all Pinochet on Portland's protestors, [throwing them into unmarked vans without charges or explanation](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/17/892277592/federal-officers-use-unmarked-vehicles-to-grab-protesters-in-portland). And even afterwards, they never made the connection: as usual, [it was all about Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/30/federal-agents-portland-oregon-trump-troops). 

This is not to say that Republicans are great defenders of freedom: the Patriot Act was essentially a wish list for the expansion of executive power that had been sitting at the bottom of a drawer in Dick Cheney's house since the Nixon administration. And I have no doubt that if tech CEO's were mostly Republicans, it would be the GOP arguing for tighter restrictions, and Dems arguing for an unrestricted internet. 

But as things stand, it isn't the GOP putting pressure on publishers to withdraw books, demanding that scientific papers not be published until they've been [examined for racial insensitivity by a committee](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/what-princeton-professors-really-think-about-defining-racism/614911/), or cheering when [Twitter and Facebook block a news story](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/14/21516194/hunter-biden-new-york-post-facebook-twitter-removed) that subsequently [turns out to have been true](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/hunter-biden-subpoena-seeks-info-burisma-entities-74698560). The Democrats are the ones doing all of those things and that makes them the greatest threat to freedom of expression and open inquiry in the country at this particular moment in history. For that reason alone, whatever we might think of the GOP, we need to regard the Democratic Party as an existential threat to a progressive movement that does most of its organizing online.

### This Wouldn't Be the First Time That the Parties Switched Ideological Places

Originally, [the GOP was the party of big government and social justice, and the Democrats were the party of States' Rights Southern slave owners](https://web.archive.org/web/20121106114224/http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2010/05/20/when-and-to-an-extent-why-did-the-parties-switch-places/). So what changed? Their voters. 

While GOP policies to fund railroad construction and industry had benefitted banks and businesses concentrated in the Northeast, they hadn't provided similar support to the farmers who had settled in the West under the Homestead Act. With the admission of Western States to the union, this created a new voting block of impoverished rural voters with their own interest in big government/social justice programs. The Dems were the first to fully appeal to this block by nominating populist William Jennings Bryan, in 1896. 

For a while the GOP competed with Dems for these voters, with Republicans like Theodore Roosevelt backing anti-trust legislation. But in both rural and urban areas, the working class and working poor continued to drift towards the Democratic Party, and as a result, its policies increasingly favored that group. By 1936 the GOP gave up on winning them over, by opposing FDR and the New Deal. 

So, we got where we are now because the parties switched their governing philosophies in response to a shift in their respective bases. With the working class now having fled back to the GOP, and upscale suburban whites having taken over the Democrats, the time is ripe for a switch back.

You might be asking now; are you really fucking serious about this? Honestly, I started this article with a tongue in my cheek, and by the time I finished it, I realized how cogent an argument you can make for the idea. At the very least I can say, I truly think your chances of reforming the GOP into a party that's less culturally conservative than it is now, while being populist on economic issues, is better than your chances of turning the Democrats towards meaningful reform. 

I also believe that even if you managed it, it would be a Pyrrhic victory, because the Democratic brand is so toxic, and the structural disadvantages so severe, that you'd essentially be working very hard to reform a party that can't win elections. So, what's the point? I think a candidate like Paula Jean Swearengin, running on the same exact platform, would do a lot better running as a Republican in West Virginia. [As a Democrat, she has no chance](https://www.businessinsider.com/west-virginia-senate-election-2020-live-vote-counts-results-2020-10).

I mentioned in a previous article that I thought a candidate campaigning on an anti-woke, economic populist message in 2024, with Kamala Harris as the presumed opponent, would end up taking at least one third of former Sanders voters and win in a landslide. At that point what I'm suggesting here be done preemptively, will become a fait accompli. 

After 2024 the GOP may very well cement its hold on the working class, by continuing to make inroads with the non-white portions of it. It might be best to get ahead of that reality, if we want a seat at the table down the line. The only other viable option is to replace the Democrats with a major new party, as the Movement for A People's Party is attempting to do, but is that more realistic than a hostile take-over the GOP? I don't think so. 

If the people won't come to you, you have to go to them. Our people aren't in the Democratic Party any longer, and it's only going to get worse.
