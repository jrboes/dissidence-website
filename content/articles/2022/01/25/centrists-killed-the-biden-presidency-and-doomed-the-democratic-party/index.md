Last week, [the Senate's 52-48 vote against filibuster reform](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/senate-voting-legislation-filibuster/index.html) drove yet another nail in the coffin that is the Biden presidency. After having failed to whip his own party's votes to pass Build Back Better in the last months of 2021, Biden attempted a "pivot" to voting rights legislation in 2022.

It was obvious to most that the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, like BBB before it, would die at the hands of Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who have been immovable in their opposition to the most important components of Biden's agenda. The two Senators are now pariahs within their own party, drawing the ire of even the most loyal Democratic voters, many of whom are already contributing to [primary efforts against them](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ps-ads-gs-20211015-launch?source=ads_ms_PS_20211015-DD-GS-Launch_brandedkw-Natl-1865U-MF_a002-PS-Branded2-gstxt-txt&gclid=CjwKCAiA0KmPBhBqEiwAJqKK48LEycn5XdLmZeLGJVrPbZfMWcO2m35pLQg8GG934cb5x-OBxU80GRoCCtcQAvD_BwE).

Of course, the irony here is that Joe Biden, Kyrsten Sinema, and Joe Manchin share the same centrist wing of the Democratic Party - you know, the one that's always claiming they're the "adults in the room" who can "work across the aisle" to "get things done." The last two presidential primaries have been battles between Bernie Sanders advocating for meaningful reforms, and moderates like Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton lecturing him and his supporters about how their ideas are unrealistic, and how centrists like them are best-positioned to actually achieve legislative goals, albeit less ambitious ones.

This intra-party compromise proposed by the moderates wins out more than it loses. In both 2016 and 2020, Democratic voters were successfully duped into accepting this bogus bargain, nominating Clinton and Biden despite being [far more aligned with Bernie on nearly every major policy issue](https://www.newsweek.com/2020-democratic-primary-bernie-sanders-polls-policies-democratic-socialism-1469949).

If there's one political development worth remembering in 2021, it's that centrists, not progressives, drowned the Biden agenda in the bathtub and sabotaged his administration. Despite candidate Biden's [nostalgia for "getting things done" with segregationist colleagues](https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-democrat-2020-segregationist-1444714) in the 1970's and his [predictions of a Republican "epiphany" following his election](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/14/politics/joe-biden-republicans-trump-epiphany/index.html) that would usher in a return to bipartisanship, his first year in office was stymied by the same legislative stalemate that defined the Obama era.

And once again, it should be noted for the history books that this impasse was arrived at not by radical socialist progressives or far-right Republicans, but by Biden's fellow "moderate" Democrats, who every election cycle fraudulently claim they're the ones who roll up their sleeves and make things happen while the ideologues on the extremes only scream and yell.

Will Democratic voters absorb any of this? Probably not. According to *Morning Joe,* Biden's problem is that he's ["moved too far left and has not been able to bring those final two Senators home."](https://youtu.be/WNobqL7YEIc?t=274) Rachel Maddow, in a particularly puzzling segment (below), defended Biden's blaming his failures on Republican obstructionism while seeming to forget that the very rationale for his presidency was that he was uniquely qualified to overcome it.

If rank and file Democrats have proven one thing in recent years, it's that they think how they're told. Despite the truth being clear as day that moderates in their own party are responsible for tanking Biden's agenda, their MSNBC thought leaders seem intent on blaming both progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans for the dysfunction in Washington. That their audience could be convinced of this even as they're made to [rail against Manchin and Sinema as "traitors"](https://newrepublic.com/article/162675/democrats-negotiating-traitors-manchin-sinema) demonstrates a cognitive dissonance that only the most committed party loyalists are capable of.

It's unlikely they'll ever snap out of it, and it's even less likely to matter whether or not they do. Come January 2023, Democrats will certainly be the minority party with virtually no power at the federal level. Between [GOP dominance of state legislatures](https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/partisan-composition.aspx) and the gerrymandering that will result from it, and the Democrats' aforementioned failure to pass voting rights legislation, this dynamic isn't likely to change anytime soon.

And so while for progressives it'd be a nice consolation prize to hear our moderate counterparts admit that their approach has been a colossal failure resulting in both political gridlock and electoral annihilation, the real lesson coming out of this past year is that the Democratic Party is on its deathbed, and that centrism was the cancer that put it there.

If there is a way forward - and that's one hell of a big *if* - it's in the form of a new organization that rises from the ashes of the Democrats' looming obliteration. There's no course correction to be made within the party, especially not with a "progressive" wing too weak to keep its most basic promise of ["holding the line"](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/jayapal-and-progressive-caucus-hold-the-line-against-corporate-democrats/) on the bipartisan infrastructure and BBB negotiations (ie, [pledging not to pass the first without the second](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/31/politics/house-biden-economic-agenda/index.html), and then [doing just that](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/house-passes-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-sends-it-to-biden.html)).

As far as the Democratic Party is concerned, the only thing left to do is write its obituary. The cause of death: a parasitic donor class attached itself to it and sucked the life out of it, rendering it incapable of performing even the most basic political functions when faced with life-or-death stakes. Or, as the Washington establishment would call it, "centrism."
