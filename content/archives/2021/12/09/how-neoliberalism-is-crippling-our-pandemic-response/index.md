In her December 6th press conference, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki sarcastically mocked a reporter's suggestion to make Covid tests free of charge to whoever needs them. Instead, she described a convoluted scheme in which qualifying individuals would be able to seek reimbursement from their insurance companies after being tested, and implied it would be too expensive to simply provide them outright (watch the exchange below):

This is the latest in a continuing series of examples which demonstrate the failure of neoliberalism to combat the coronavirus pandemic. 

The implosion of the Build Back Better negotiations is another. At this writing, the second-most costly provision in this supposed "human infrastructure" bill is a [$280 billion tax cut for the rich](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/11/16/second-biggest-program-democrats-budget-gives-billions-rich/), courtesy of the same party that won't fund tuition free community college.

Perhaps most egregiously, the Biden administration continues to drag its feet on waiving vaccine patent protections, an essential step in making the vaccine available to everyone in the world. Weeks ago, Biden [announced his support for taking such action](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/26/biden-calls-for-intellectual-property-waivers-covid-vaccines), but as of yet it hasn't happened. Every day it doesn't is more money for the Pharma giants who developed the formula.

The federal government isn't the only perpetrator. As journalist Walker Bragman lays out [in his recent article](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/12/new-york-governor-real-estate-campaign-contributions-covid-reopening), New York governor Kathy Hochul is pushing for workers to return to the office as soon as possible, despite her administration's growing concerns about the omicron variant.

Hochul recently took [emergency action to better prepare hospitals](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-urgent-action-boost-hospital-capacity-and-address-staffing-shortages) for the arrival of omicron, as Covid cases are spiking throughout her state. Why, then, out of the other side of her mouth, is she stressing the importance of ending the era of working from home, a safe and efficient alternative to commuting?

Bragman suggests that the answer lies with her tight connections to New York commercial real estate interests, who have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the state Democratic Party in recent years, and supported Hochul herself when she was Andrew Cuomo's lieutenant governor.

From real estate to Big Pharma to the various special interests who successfully gutted the Build Back Better plan, it's clear that even in the most dire circumstances, our leadership is still committed to the neoliberal premise which works backwards from the premise that the solution to every problem is and must always be market-based. 

Psaki's knee-jerk dismissal of free Covid testing shows the lack of imagination and will power to provide a universal public service, no strings attached. Instead, we insist on devising overly complicated bureaucratic arrangements which attempt to reconcile the needs of the public with the profit motive of dominant market actors. 

The result is a pandemic that's poised to enter its third year on yet another upswing, with no real end in sight despite the development and distribution of the vaccine.
