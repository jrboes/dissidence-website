Even Joe Biden's insultingly meager campaign promise of [$10,000 in student debt relief for borrowers in exchange for public service](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/biden-proposes-forgiving-10000-in-student-debt-for-public-service.html) seemed dubious at the time he made it. After all, this is the guy who deemed it [impossible to discharge student loans in bankruptcy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/02/joe-biden-student-loan-debt-2005-act-2020), and has been a lifelong prostitute for [credit card companies](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/joe-biden-senate-credit-card-companies-peter-navarro) and [big banks](https://www.propublica.org/article/bidens-cozy-relations-with-bank-industry-825), both of whom profit greatly off the interest from their clients' crippling debts.

Sure enough, his administration dealt student borrowers a brutal one-two punch this week, when it was announced that the federal student loan payment freeze will [expire at the end of January,](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/14/politics/student-loans-biden-february/index.html) and [no executive action will be taken](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2021/12/15/biden-will-cancel-student-loans-but-congress-hasnt-passed-legislation/?sh=5fff67b82e78) to deliver on his pledge to cancel the aforementioned $10,000 in debt.

Regarding the former, Press Secretary Jen Psaki made it clear to reporters that ["a smooth transition back into repayment is a high priority for the administration."](http://A smooth transition back into repayment is a high priority for the administration.) Given Biden's decades-long aversion to debt relief of any kind, this shouldn't come as much of a surprise. His home state of Delaware has long been a sort of Guantanamo Bay for parasitic money lenders, having [drafted tax codes in their favor](https://www.smartcapitalmind.com/why-do-so-many-credit-card-companies-have-a-wilmington-delaware-address.htm) in order to lure them away from New York.

Disgusting as it is, at least Biden's plan to restart student loan payments in February is being straightforwardly stated and spelled out. When it comes to his broken promise of debt forgiveness, the White House's betrayal of student borrowers is sleazier and more dishonest.

When Psaki was pressed on the issue this week, she responded by saying, "If Congress sends him a bill, he's happy to sign it. They haven't sent him a bill on that yet."

Three things are made clear by this answer.

First, that the Biden administration would defer on this issue to an obviously and demonstrably dysfunctional Congress shows they have no intention whatsoever to deliver on their promise of debt forgiveness.

Second, they trust that the portion of their base who needs whatever relief they can get, even $10,000, which for many borrowers would barely make a dent in the interest, much less the principal, is too stupid to realize they're being strung along. 

Third, they've assessed that the true power base of their party, upper middle class suburbanite *Morning Joe* junkies drooling over [Sean Hannity's texts to Mark Meadows on January 6th](https://www.thedailybeast.com/sean-hannity-hosts-mark-meadows-after-their-bombshell-text-drops-ignores-it-completely), don't very much care about student debt or those affected by it. These are the last of the die hard "Blue No Matter Who" faithful, who see the Democratic Party as all that stands between us and a fascist takeover of our government, even as their beloved Democratic administration [tortures Julian Assange to death](https://scheerpost.com/2021/12/13/hedges-the-execution-of-julian-assange/) in broad daylight for publishing truthful information about our military crimes.

These MSNBC-addled bimbos are endlessly loyal, and their monthly donations to ActBlue may keep the Democrats' delusions of viability alive through the summer of next year. But come November 2022, the Democratic Party is in for the rude awakening that their sycophants may have deep pockets, but they can only vote once, and there aren't enough of them left to save them from political annihilation.

Most of the country aren't naked partisans, and much of the country stopped giving a shit about January 6th on January 7th, because much of the country understands that the real coup has long been over, and that the true "insurrectionists" are those like Biden, Pelosi, Manchin, and Sinema, who keep the door open for corporate donors to storm the Capitol much like the police let the rioters in.

And so, most of the country sees no reason to vote for these ghouls ever again. Their stab in the back on student loans is the latest, but almost certainly not the last, betrayal between now and Election Day next year. It hasn't gone unnoticed.

The real fascists have already won. The Democrats' new base of affluent white cable news addicts are the last ones not to realize this, because they're the last ones not to have their "rights" trampled upon by America's true oppressors: banks, credit card companies, insurance companies, and the like.

Dark days ahead for Democrats and their supporters - they deserve every minute.
